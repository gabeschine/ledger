# Cloud dashboard

Web dashboard allowing a signed-in user to inspect their Ledger state and
trigger cloud erase if needed.

This project is built using Angular was originally scaffolded using  version 1.2.1.

## Development workflow

Make sure that you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed.

Then, you can use Angular CLI (`ng`) in the `cloud_dashboard` directory:

 - Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

 - Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

 - Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

 - Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
